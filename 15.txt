Later, three guest speakers — Dr. Elvina Mustary (Deputy Program Director in Reproductive Health Services Training and Education Program), Mr. Saifullah Al Mahmud (Certified Self-Defense Instructor of British Combat Association), and Mr. Tahseen Salman Choudhury (Comic Researcher and Host of the radio show ‘Comicbaj’) — conducted sessions on ‘Reproductive Health’, ‘How Not to Become a Victim’, and ‘Equality with Comics’ respectively. The interactive sessions reflected this year’s official theme of the International Women’s Day – “Time is Now: Rural and urban activists transforming women’s lives”. Members of ULAB Nutrition and Wellness Club also performed a drama titled “See me through a Gender-less Lens”. The event ended with a 30-minute workshop conducted and supervised by Mr. Choudhury where the participating students were asked to come up with comic stories reflecting gender equality. About 90 students took part in this comic-style story-telling contest. Afterwards, Ms. Arzoo Ismail, Advisor NWC, and Chairperson SHCC of ULAB thanked everyone and formally closed the event.
