Email Sign Up or sign in with Google Facebook Reading a File Containing Words in Order to Count its Frequency Ask Question up vote -1 down vote favorite I am working on a program that will read a file in order to find the frequency of words. I have to create a void method that will read the file of unique words to count it. I am completely new to Java. I have been reading my textbook and other online sources in order to understand the concept/process of reading a file for this specific purpose, but I am still struggling to implement the logic of it. I'd like to know what I am missing/or doing wrong that prevents me from reading the file to count the frequency of words. Here is my code: [This is a part of my code. The other methods(such as the method for sorting the frequency and getting the output) are also within the same class - not included here.] import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;


public class CountingFrequencyOfWords
{
       int frequency  [] = new int [999];
       String words []  = new String [999];


       int uniqueCount = 0;
       int count_Word= 0;


       public void methodForInput() throws Exception
       {

             File file = new File("file.txt");
             Scanner input = new Scanner(file);

             String x;
             int i = 0;

             while(input.hasNext())
             {

                   x = input.next();
                   count_Word[i] = x;
                   i =  i + 1;


                   if (i == uniqueCount)
                   {

                         uniqueCount[i] = x;
                         uniqueCount = uniqueCount + 1;

What is it that you actually want people to post, in response to this? – Dawood ibn Kareem May 15 '14 at 2:10 @DavidWallace, I want to know how I can get this method to read a file in order to count the words within the existing file. – Charlotte.P May 15 '14 at 2:13 OK, but you say you've already written some methods that you haven't shown us. I'm not sure which bit you're missing. In any case, I would suggest you create a HashMap<String,Integer>, keyed by the words that you find, and increment the Integer every time you see a word. Is that the part that you don't know how to do? – Dawood ibn Kareem May 15 '14 at 2:15 @DavidWallace, yeah...but I have to use two arrays for this specific program. – Charlotte.P May 15 '14 at 2:23 @Charlotte.P Create a String array, and an integer array. The string array holds all unique words you've encountered. The integer array holds each word's frequency. For each word in file, find the word in your string array, and increment the corresponding index in your integer array. if the word doesn't exist, add it to your string array. – William Morrison May 15 '14 at 2:30 | show 8 more comments 2 Answers 2 active oldest votes up vote 0 down vote Well I cant tell you now that count_Word and uniqueCount are not arrays so count_word[i] and uniqueCount[i] will screw you up. And x is a String so adding it to the int variables you'll get exceptions thrown. other than that i think your reading the file is fine. share|improve this answer answered May 15 '14 at 2:58 MGHandy 180210 add a comment | up vote 0 down vote it...is very very very necessary to use try & catch block for your methodForInput() function because in the declaration of your methodForInput() function you have thrown an Exception public void methodForInput() throws Exception ...so now you have to catch this exception where you call your function if it is thrown during the execution of program......here is the block of code: try{   //try it for exception
    methodForInput();
}catch(Exception e){
    System.out.println(e); //print the exception if it is thrown during execution of program
}
 don't worry if exception is not thrown...if no exception occur then code run without any problem if exception occur then it will be displayed by System.out.println(e);........I think it may help you..& don't forget to make methodForInput() method as static.....good luck... share|improve this answer edited May 15 '14 at 3:20 Dawood ibn Kareem 50.5k85286 answered May 15 '14 at 3:15 Ankit 1287 add a comment | Your Answer draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.

 don't worry if exception is not thrown...if no exception occur then code run without any problem if exception occur then it will be displayed by System.out.println(e);........I think it may help you..& don't forget to make methodForInput() method as static.....good luck... share|improve this answer edited May 15 '14 at 3:20 Dawood ibn Kareem 50.5k85286 answered May 15 '14 at 3:15 Ankit 1287 add a comment | Your Answer draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.

up vote -1 down vote favorite I am working on a program that will read a file in order to find the frequency of words.

Charlotte, do you have a specific question? What is it that you actually want people to post, in response to this? – Dawood ibn Kareem May 15 '14 at 2:10 @DavidWallace, I want to know how I can get this method to read a file in order to count the words within the existing file. – Charlotte.P May 15 '14 at 2:13 OK, but you say you've already written some methods that you haven't shown us. I'm not sure which bit you're missing. In any case, I would suggest you create a HashMap<String,Integer>, keyed by the words that you find, and increment the Integer every time you see a word. Is that the part that you don't know how to do? – Dawood ibn Kareem May 15 '14 at 2:15 @DavidWallace, yeah...but I have to use two arrays for this specific program. – Charlotte.P May 15 '14 at 2:23 @Charlotte.P Create a String array, and an integer array. The string array holds all unique words you've encountered. The integer array holds each word's frequency. For each word in file, find the word in your string array, and increment the corresponding index in your integer array. if the word doesn't exist, add it to your string array. – William Morrison May 15 '14 at 2:30 | show 8 more comments

I'm not sure which bit you're missing. In any case, I would suggest you create a HashMap<String,Integer>, keyed by the words that you find, and increment the Integer every time you see a word. Is that the part that you don't know how to do? – Dawood ibn Kareem May 15 '14 at 2:15 @DavidWallace, yeah...but I have to use two arrays for this specific program. – Charlotte.P May 15 '14 at 2:23 @Charlotte.P Create a String array, and an integer array. The string array holds all unique words you've encountered. The integer array holds each word's frequency. For each word in file, find the word in your string array, and increment the corresponding index in your integer array. if the word doesn't exist, add it to your string array. – William Morrison May 15 '14 at 2:30
Charlotte, do you have a specific question? What is it that you actually want people to post, in response to this? – Dawood ibn Kareem May 15 '14 at 2:10 @DavidWallace, I want to know how I can get this method to read a file in order to count the words within the existing file. – Charlotte.P May 15 '14 at 2:13 OK, but you say you've already written some methods that you haven't shown us.

up vote 0 down vote it...is very very very necessary to use try & catch block for your methodForInput() function because in the declaration of your methodForInput() function you have thrown an Exception public void methodForInput() throws Exception ...so now you have to catch this exception where you call your function if it is thrown during the execution of program......here is the block of code: try{   //try it for exception
    methodForInput();
}catch(Exception e){
